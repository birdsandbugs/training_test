```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

# Read in the data
```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1",
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

# Make data tidy

I in column chinook (row 401) should be a 1.

```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_original %>% 
    select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>%
    mutate(Chinook = ifelse(Chinook == "I", 1, Chinook)) %>% 
    mutate(Chinook = as.integer(Chinook))
    
```

## Data QA 

Determine which values were converted to NA by as.numeric.

```{r}

i <- which(is.na(catch_clean$Chinook))

catch_original[i,]

```

## Convert to long format

```{r}

catch_long <- catch_clean %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -c(Region, Year), 
                 names_to = "species",
                 values_to = "catch") %>%
    rename(catch_thousands = catch) %>% 
    mutate(catch = catch_thousands*1000)

```
